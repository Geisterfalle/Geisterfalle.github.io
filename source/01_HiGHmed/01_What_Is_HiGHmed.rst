What is HiGHmed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Within HiGHmed, we iteratively create an open platform specification to support the interconnection of care provision and research domian between independent organizations to facilitate data sharing
- The platform is a socio-technical process: it involves a technical platform as well as a collaborative information governance approach. 
- A platform approach will provide the following benefits
	- Allowing greater control over data, by separating data from technology and applications
	- Supporting those organizations pursuing an enterprise-wide EPR
	- Supporting those organizations with a 'best-of-breed' approach to EPR.
	- Provide a common infrastructure to build semantic interoperable application systems and research databases
- The combination of IHE XDS and openEHR will be the core of the platform
- The Archetype Query Language will allow for model-based and fine-grained queries in a distributed environment to improve research capabilities and decision making
